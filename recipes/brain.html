        <h2>Dr Lecter's chill out dessert</h2>

        <p> <em>Nose-to-tail eating and honoring the whole animal is a dying art, and, even among those who occasionally eat organ meats, 
            brains are a one-off, and occupy a curious place in the hierarchy of organ meats.</em></p>

        <p><em> "Imagine" eating this with Dr. Lecter, what an adorable sight and bonding time!</em></p>
        
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brains (2-3 oz pieces per person, pork and lamb are the most common)</li>
                <li>Chopped tarragon chives, chervil, and parsley</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Unsalted butter</li>
                <li>Splash of white wine</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Slices of good toast (like brioche)</li>
                <li>Finely diced shallots</li>
            </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk enough milk to cover the brains by 3x their volume with salt, just until you can taste it. Immerse the brains in the salt milk, then allow to sit overnight.</li>
                <li>The next day, drain and rinse the brains and pat completely dry. If you can remove the thin membrane, do so, but if it seems to tough, or you can find it, don't worry, I don't find it offensive, but the brains may curl a bit more as they cook.</li>
                <li>To cook, heat a pan with butter until lightly browned, dredge the brains in flour, tap off the excess, and fry golden on each side.</li>
                <li>Add the shallots, season lightly with salt, then deglaze the pan with the wine, cook down by half, and add enough cream to make a good sauce, enough to completely coat the brains, and then some.</li>
                <li>Simmer the brains for a bit in the sauce until lightly thickened, then whisk in a tablespoon or two of butter, then the herbs and lemon juice. Finally, double check the seasoning one last time, adjust as needed, and serve on top of thin slices of toasted brioche.</li>
            </ol>
